        <p>
          As I look ahead, I am excited about the opportunities and challenges
          that lie on the horizon. Over the next two years, I aim to deepen my
          expertise and broaden my skill set in the tech field. Here are some

            <h3>Grounding in Frontend Designing:</h3>
            <p>
              I am committed to enhancing my frontend design skills,
              particularly in creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user
              interfaces. Mastery in tools and frameworks is key, and I plan to
              delve deeper into advanced CSS techniques and frameworks like
              Tailwind CSS and SCSS to achieve more efficient and scalable
              styling.

            <h3>Extensive Use of React:</h3>
            <p>
              React has become a cornerstone of modern web development, and I
              aim to utilize it extensively in my projects. My goal is to become
              proficient in building dynamic and responsive web applications
              using React, leveraging its component-based architecture and state
              management capabilities to deliver robust solutions.

              will focus on understanding database management systems,
              optimizing queries, and integrating databases seamlessly with my
              applications. Additionally, I will explore the use of external
              APIs to enhance the functionality and interactivity of my
              projects.

              To enhance my backend capabilities, I plan to learn PHP,
              particularly for handling form submissions and server-side
              scripting. This knowledge will complement my frontend skills and
              enable me to build more dynamic and interactive web applications.
